## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 (Foundation): Async job queue over sync API - Model inference takes minutes; sync would timeout
- Phase 1 (Foundation): Static images over video preview - Simpler, meets requirements, saves time
- Phase 1 (Foundation): Single Docker compose setup - "Single command" requirement, easier deployment
